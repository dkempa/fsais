This is not yet the official release, so please do not share this
code. Type 'make' in the directory with Makefile to compile. Give it a
minute -- it takes quite a while due to heavy template usage. View
main.cpp for instructions on how to use the program, it's easy to
figure out. There are two things that I think are worth mentioning:

1. You might run into an issue of having too many open files when
running fSAIS. There is an easy fix. Let me know when you run into any
problems and I can explain the solution.

2. Uncomment the line with MONITOR_DISK_USAGE in the Makefile to
display additional stats (alternative I/O counter (used mostly to
verify that the in-code counting of I/O volume is correct), and stats
about disk usage). The program with this flag enabled runs slower, so
please use it only when you need these additional stats. I also have
an external script to measure the peak disk usage (which I used to
test the in-code tracking of disk usage), which I can share. Let me
know if you are interested.


Feel free to ask if you have any questions or run into any problems,
e.g., something doesn't work or works slower than expected.
